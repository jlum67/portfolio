        <p class="par">Hi, it's nice to meet you! My name is Koala, and I'm currently a sophomore at
            Brown University studying Computer Science and History. My main interests
            are in full-stack development, UI/UX, and computer systems, but I'm still learning
            a lot about CS and discovering what my passions are! 

            <br>
            <br>

            <!-- You might be wondering why I'm also studying history. I've always
            been interested in the applications of historical lessons to the 
            present, and 

            <br>
            <br> -->

            In my free time, I love baking and exploring the outdoors! I'm an 
            avid camper, backpacker, and hiker. I also love running, and will
            be doing a half-marathon next year. 

            <br>
            <br>

            I hope you enjoy taking a look at my portfolio! Feel free to reach
            out with any questions.

            <p class="inner_txt space">Before finalizing our hi-fi prototype, we received and made revisions based on the following critiques from our peers:</p>

            <ul class="inner_txt list">
              <li>Increase the size of text, which could cause readibility issues for some users.</li>
              <li>Increase the color contrast between the originally light pink button on top of the purple background.</li>
              <li>Have the chat box in the livestream be collapsible.</li>
              <li>Make the "Create Your Own Event" template stand out more.</li>
              <li>Make the Pre-Stream Checklist icons more apparent that they are clickable.</li>
              <li>Place the "Upload your own image" option before the built-in photos, since it makes more sense for users to add their own photos for personal events.</li>
              <li>Include both a "Join" and "Details" button for events that are about to start, as opposed to just "Join."</li>
              <li>Add clarity to the fact that more guests can be invited to an event.</li>

            <h2 class="it_title3"><b>prototype</b></h2>

            <p class="inner_txt space">Based on our sketches and the class critiques, we finalized a high fidelity 
              prototype. While prototyping, we also kept in mind Lovecast's stated mission and goals, 
              which we have listed below and described how we addressed them. </p>

               <ul class="inner_txt">
                <li><b>Goal #1: Host various events.</b></li>
                <ul>
                  <li class="list">Addressed by: Having event templates on the home page to make creating events a seamless process for the user.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Goal #2: Join events from around the world.</b></li>
                <ul>
                  <li  class="list">Addressed by: A clearly laid out invitations page, and also featuring upcoming events on the home page for accessibility.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Goal #3: Make events interactive for all participants.</b></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Addressed by: Livestream with chat box and emoticon reactions. We also considered the functionality of video streaming and included video settings, participant settings, etc.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>

              <p class="inner_txt">Here is our high-fidelity prototype, made in Figma. Hope you enjoy!</p>

              <!-- user testing -->
              <h2 class="it_title3"><b>user testing</b></h2>

              <p class="inner_txt space"> After completing our high fidelity prototype, we went through a second round of feedback by 
                submitting our updated prototype to UserTesting, where 
                three testers would complete a task and provide 
                feedback on how the process went for them. </p>

                <ul class="inner_txt">
                  <li class="list"><b>Task #1: Start the tea party event.</b></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> None of the three testers had trouble finding the "Start" 
                      button and clicking the "Go Live" button. They all 
                      rated the task as 5 (very easy). This was in line with 
                      our expectations since we intentionally made the "Start" 
                      button for the upcoming events green and right below the 
                      event name so that it was easy for users to recognize 
                      and find.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li class="list"><b>Task #2: Check that the camera, audio, 
                    and connection settings work.</b></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Users were able to successfully 
                      open the popup for each setting and also all rated the 
                      task as 5 (very easy). This matched our expectations 
                      since we had icons as buttons that represented each 
                      setting option, along with text labeling the setting 
                      so users would have a smooth experience understanding 
                      and adjusting the appropriate settings.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li class="list"><b>Task #3: End the livestream.</b></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>All users were able 
                      to quickly find the "Exit Stream" button and leave the 
                      page. All testers rated the task as 5 (very easy). This 
                      aligned with our expectations because we made the 
                      "Exit Stream" button red and at the top left of the screen, 
                      where people generally expect quit buttons, so they can 
                      easily exit the stream.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>

                <p class="inner_txt"> Based on our UserTesting results and 
                  feedback, we wouldn't change much about our interface, 
                  as all users gave positive feedback and didn't have any 
                  struggles. There was no unexpected behavior.</p>

                  things that come to mind are transparency and accessibility to information and resources. 
                  This made me wonder whether different governments around the world — who should make information 
                  transparent and accessible to their citizens — designed websites with sufficient usability, 
                  learnability, and memorability. With this in mind, I researched different countries’ government 
                  websites, and arbitrarily came across China’s government website, which I thought had some room 
                  for improvement.

                <p class="section" ><b>Finding problems with the webpage:</b></p>

                <ul class="inner_txt list">
                  <li>Lack of hierarchy, since section headings use different fonts, colors, and backgrounds. </li>
                  <li>Lack of sufficient text and background contrast in some areas, making content difficult to read.</li>
                  <li>No clear form of navigating through the site. Though there are navigation bar-like components on the left and right side of the screen, the user must scroll through the page to see what options are available to them. </li>
                  <li>Interactive elements (hovering and clicking) are not consistent throughout the page. Some items react with underline when hovering, while others have no response at all. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Users are not aware of system status, since clicking buttons sometimes has no response. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Site is not responsive on different devices. The whole screen just becomes smaller, making the font hard to read and the site even harder to navigate.</li>
                  <li>Very text heavy and has irrelevant information for a home page, which "hides" relevant content and makes the site overwhelming for users. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Sections of site are sometimes left unlabeled, leaving users confused as to what they are looking at.</li>
                  <li>Lack of logo or site title makes user unsure of what site they are even looking at.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="section" ><b>Accessibility:</b></p>

                <p class="inner_txt"> <a class="href" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwave.webaim.org%2F&sa=D">WebAIM WAVE</a> was used to detect possible accessibility problems with the site. 
                  and my main takeaways from the evaluation were that:
                </p>

                <ul class="inner_txt list">
                  <li>There was no heading structure.</li>
                  <li>No page regions or ARIA landmarks were found. </li>
                  <li>The language of the site was not identified with a lang attribute.</li>
                  <li>Layout tables were used, which create reading and navigation order issues for screen readers. </li>
                  <li>No alternative text was used for images, which makes them "invisible" to screen readers, and users when an image is unavailable. </li>
                  <li>Low contrast between text and background. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="inner_txt_end">I definitely agree with the problems detected, 
                  particularly the issues with no heading structure and low text-background contrast. 
                  In my initial analysis of the site, I could not recognize different sections of the page since 
                  inconsistent headings, color, and fonts were used for content that should have the same hierarchy level. 
                  In addition, I also found some text difficult to read due to the background color and lack of contrast. 
                  The other accessibility problems that the evaluation found aren't visible upon looking at the site, 
                  but I can understand why they create barriers to accessing information for screen readers.

                            I can define how many columns each section of my site takes up, and explicitly code how this should change 
                            based on the screen size. I can also define the order of the divs based on the size of the screen. 
                            For the grid system, I split my entire site into 2 sections/divs. One includes the News and Resources 
                            components, and the other includes the Most Requested components.</p>

                                why it appears on top in smaller screens). </li>

                  <p class="inner_txt space"> This project was basically my first time creating a website from the design process 
                    all the way to the coding process, and I really enjoyed it! I gained a lot of insight into not only 
                    syntax conventions for HTML and CSS, but also learned about how to best utilize components such as flex box,
                    media tags, and bootstrap grids. It was also interesting to see how the different parts of a website affect 
                    accessibility. The most challenging part of this project was definitely making my site responsive, but I look 
                    forward to using what I've learned to build more responsive websites! </p>

                     nearby dining halls are open. Vending machines meet this gap for her. Since Ava is a 
                     consistent user, she has more experience with the frustrations of using the vending machine, 
                     and the lower-probability events of payment not working or food getting stuck are more 
                     familiar to her . Her interface problems include:  </p>

                      <li>The inconsistency of vending machine selections, leading her to be unable to anticipate if her desired items are available.

                      <li>The inability to see the nutritional contents of the food she's eating, which is important to her since she frequently exercises and needs to properly recuperate.

                I gained more insight into how to effectively perform user interviews as well as 
                visually represent my user research and observations! Generally, I think people 
                find that the vending machine interface makes sense and matches the users' 
                mental model. However, there are different aspects of the process that could be 
                smoothened and made more efficient to increase overall user satisfaction. </p>
